## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#three tick marks say its going to be code and the lower case r says it will be in r not python
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
install.packages("gt")
library(gt)
disasters <- read_csv(file, skip = 6, col_names = TRUE, col_types = "ciifffffcfffffccfffccnnfcccciiiiiiiiiiinnnn")
s <- (min(disasters$Year))
e <- (max(disasters$Year))
'''


plot(pressure)
```
